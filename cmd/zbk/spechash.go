// specHash is a Merkle hash over a project AS RESOLVED: its platform, its
// name, the version it resolved to, the content of the recipe (or recipes)
// that describe it, and the hashes of its dependencies.
//
// # WHOSE IDEA THIS IS
//
// Spack's, exactly. Its packaging guide states what goes into a spec hash:
// "build, link, and run dependencies all affect the hash of Spack packages
// (along with sha256 sums of patches and archives used to build the package,
// and a canonical hash of the package.py recipes)".
//
// The part worth copying is the last clause. Pinning versions catches an
// upstream that moved; hashing the RECIPE catches the other half — a build
// script edited in the pantry resolves to the same version and produces a
// different package. A lock with versions alone calls those two builds the
// same, which is the thing a lock exists not to do.
//
// # WHAT "CANONICAL" MEANS HERE, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
//
// Spack canonicalises package.py's AST, dropping comments and docstrings.
// Here the recipe is parsed YAML or HCL, and the hash is taken over the
// PARSED value re-serialised as JSON with sorted keys. So reformatting a
// recipe, reordering its mapping keys or rewriting its comments does not
// move the hash, and changing what it says does.
//
// It is NOT a hash of the file. A recipe whose meaning is identical through
// two different spellings hashes alike, and that is deliberate: a lock that
// invalidated on whitespace would be re-taken until it stopped meaning
// anything.
//
// # BOTH HALVES, BECAUSE THE CLOSURE READS BOTH
//
// A project can be described by the pantry AND by our overlay, and
// closureRecipes returns both because they say different things. The hash
// covers both, in the order the closure reads them: a hash taken over one
// half would describe a different graph from the one beside it in the same
// file.
// ⛔ THE CANONICAL FORM MOVED TO zbk/spec, AND THE BYTES DID NOT. This now
// formats the dependency identities and delegates; the domain line, the
// field order and the recipe hashing are the ones every existing lock file
// was written with, so `lock --check` still compares like with like. The
// reason it moved is that it sat in `package main`, where the BUILD could not
// reach it — so the factory published 42 756 bottles with no identity while a
// correct one sat two directories away (go-zpkg/zbk#410).
