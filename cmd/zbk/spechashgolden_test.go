// ⛔⛔ THE LOCK HASH IS A PUBLISHED VALUE AND THIS PINS IT.
//
// Every lock file ever written holds hashes computed by specHash, and
// `zbk lock --check` compares them. A refactor that moves one byte of the
// canonical form silently invalidates all of them — `--check` would report
// every project as changed, which reads as "the pantry moved" rather than
// "the tool did".
//
// There was no such test when the canonical form was lifted out of
// `package main` into zbk/spec. The suite passed, and it proved nothing: not
// one test named a hash VALUE, so the whole lock suite would have passed on
// a different format. The equivalence was real —
//
//	Fprintf("dep %s %s\n", d, dh)  ==  Fprintf("dep %s\n", d+" "+dh)
//
// — but it was established by reading, and reading is not a control.
