// runReproduce implements `zbk reproduce`: are two bottles the same bottle,
// and if not, in what way.
//
// ⛔⛔ THE FACTORY HAS NEVER HAD A STANDING ANSWER TO THIS, AND THE ONE TIME
// IT WAS ASKED BY HAND IT FOUND A DEFECT. On 2026-09-29 zlib.net 1.3.2 was
// built on the s390x seed VM before and after the VM was replaced:
//
//	every FILE byte-identical, 14 entries either side
//	directories   0755 → 0775      the two hosts' umasks, 0022 and 0002
//
// bottlepkg.normalise fixes that class now, citing reproducible-builds.org.
// But a class of defect that is only ever found by hand is a class that comes
// back, and "the digests differ" is not a finding — it is the start of an
// afternoon with two tarballs. This reports WHICH entry and HOW.
//
// ⛔ IT DOES NOT BUILD ANYTHING, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Driving two
// sovereign builds belongs in a workflow with a runner and an hour; the
// comparison is the part with a verdict in it, and it is useful on its own
// the moment anyone has two bottles — a rebuild against a published one, one
// architecture's build against another's, before and after a toolchain bump.
// Shipping the verdict first means the workflow has something to call.
//
// ⛔ TWO QUESTIONS, NAMED SEPARATELY. bottlepkg does NOT fix mtime to an
// epoch: a bottle's timestamps say when it was made, which that package
// documents as a policy choice rather than an oversight. So two builds an
// hour apart differ BY DESIGN, and `-ignore-mtime` asks the other question —
// "identical apart from timestamps" — instead of quietly relaxing the first.
// A reader of the output can always tell which was asked, because the summary
// says so.
