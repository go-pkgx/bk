//
// Where the ELF lives depends on the glibc vintage: a modern bottle ships
// lib/glibc-X.Y/libc.so.6 as a regular file, while glibc before 2.34 ships the
// image as libc-X.Y.so with libc.so.6 a SYMLINK to it (tar carries no content
// for a symlink). Both are handled — and `libc.so` is deliberately not, since
// that one is a linker script, not an ELF.
// ABIProvidesAnnotation lists the sonames a bottle's shared libraries call
// themselves by, comma-separated and sorted.
//
// The compatibility key of a shared library is its soname, and a pkgx
// constraint cannot express one: libxml2 2.13.9 ships libxml2.2.dylib and
// 2.15.4 ships libxml2.16.dylib, and `^2` admits both. Recording what a bottle
// PROVIDES is the half that can be computed locally; with it, a checker can ask
// of any published version whether it still provides the soname a dependent
// recorded, and refuse a constraint that cannot honour it
// (go-zpkg/packages#207).
//

// reads it; today only bk writes it, so it lives here rather than forcing a
// cross-repo bump for a field nothing consumes yet.

// second observation on go-zpkg/pkgm#73, where the stray `abi-libtiffxx.so.6
// -> v1.27.3` symlink turned up inside the go.dev store directory.
//
// That is not cosmetic: the whole point of the annotation is that the resolver
// keys ABI compatibility on sonames (go-zpkg/bottle#83) and a consumer binds
// through `abi-<soname>`. A claim to provide libtiffxx.so.6 is an offer to
