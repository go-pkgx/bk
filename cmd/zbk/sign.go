// runSign implements `zbk sign`: a SECOND builder's word on a bottle somebody
// else published.
//
// ⛔⛔ THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT IT DOES NOT PUBLISH ANYTHING. Two people who
// build the same inputs get the same identity — deliberately, because an
// identity that varied with the builder could never be compared. So the
// artefact stays one artefact, and what differs is the ATTESTATION: each
// builder attaches their own signature referrer to the one bottle, and a
// client counts how many distinct trusted keys it can verify
// (ZPKG_TRUST_THRESHOLD).
//
// This is the publishing half of what `zbk reproduce` already does locally.
// The sequence a rebuilder follows:
//
//	zbk build …                     # your own build, your own machine
//	zbk reproduce yours.tar.gz theirs.tar.gz
//	zbk sign -key you.sec -project … -version … yours.tar.gz
//
// ⛔ AND IT REFUSES WHEN THE DIGESTS DIFFER, WHICH IS THE INTERESTING CASE.
// Guix's `guix challenge` exists to report exactly that, and the report is
// the finding: a divergence means the recipe is not reproducible, or one of
// the two machines is not what it claims. Signing anyway would convert a
// finding into a second signature on a bottle this build did NOT produce,
// which is the one thing the threshold must never be able to say.
