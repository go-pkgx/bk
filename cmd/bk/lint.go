// runLint implements `bk lint`: read every recipe in a pantry checkout and
// say which ones cannot be read.
//
// A pantry recipe is not a build input anyone can retry. A consumer fetches it
// over HTTP while resolving a closure, so a file that does not parse breaks
// every install of that project — silently, for everyone, with no build to go
// red first. That is the failure a pantry repository is uniquely able to
// cause, and the only one this checks for.
//
// It reads them with recipefile.Load, which is the loader the BUILDER uses:
// the same formats, the same schema, the same refusals. The check this
// replaces was a script that re-stated parts of the schema in another
// language, and it could only ever be a second opinion about what a recipe
// means — it went looking for package.yml and reported "the layout changed"
// the day the recipes became HCL, which is the mildest way that kind of
// divergence can present.
