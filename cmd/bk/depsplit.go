// runDepsplit implements `bk depsplit`: find the recipes that name ONE project
// in BOTH dependency lists with constraints that select DIFFERENT versions.
//
// ⛔ WHY THAT IS A DEFECT AND NOT A STYLE. build.go keeps the two lists apart
// deliberately — EvalLinkDeps is "the set a build LINKS against: the recipe's
// own runtime dependencies, and nothing else", EvalToolDeps is the build
// dependencies, whose "version constraints are nobody else's business". That
// separation is what lets qt.io build: unicode.org ^71 to link, ^73 to run
// nodejs, two ICUs that are never in one process.
//
// The case it does not cover is the SAME project in both. Then two versions
// of one library land in one build environment, and which supplies headers
// and which supplies libraries is decided by search order rather than by the
// recipe. Measured on protobuf.dev 36.2 (darwin/aarch64, 2026-10-26):
//
//	dependencies:        abseil.io: "*"        -> 20260817  (headers)
//	build.dependencies:  abseil.io: ^20260526  -> 20260526  (libraries)
//	=> ld: "absl::lts_20260817::Mutex::AssertHeld() const", referenced from: …
//	   symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64
//
// When the same disagreement happens to LINK instead of failing it is worse:
// the bottle ships an @rpath reference to the version the headers came from
// while declaring the constraint a consumer will resolve differently. That is
// an uninstallable bottle, published green.
//
// ⛔ THE VERDICT IS "DIFFERENT VERSION", NOT "DIFFERENT TEXT". `*` and `>=1`
// differ as strings and almost never as answers; `*` and ^20260526 differ as
// answers. Only the second is worth a line, so the comparison resolves both
// constraints against what the registry actually carries FOR THIS PLATFORM,
// through bottle's own semver — the code pkgx uses at install, so a
// disagreement reported here is one a build will meet.
