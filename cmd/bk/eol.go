// to be wrong with this version". A line upstream has abandoned has nothing
// known about it yet and never will, because nobody is looking and no fix is
// coming — so `bk vulnfetch` and the daily sweep return a clean zero for a
// package whose upstream stopped issuing fixes years ago. End-of-life is not a
// CVE, and nothing here could say so until this existed.

// Measured 2026-10-29, which is why it was written: the registry publishes
// openssl 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 4.0. 3.2 and 3.3 were already out of
// support, 3.4 went out on 2026-10-22, and 3.6 goes out on 2026-11-01 — while
// `^3` resolves to the newest 3.x, which is 3.6. The default resolution was
// three days from an unsupported line, with the 3.5 LTS sitting unused in the
// same registry.
