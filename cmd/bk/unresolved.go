// It is the SYMPTOM whose cause `bk undeclared` reports, and the two answer
// different questions. A missing declaration is a packaging defect; an
// unresolvable reference is what the loader will actually refuse, and a bottle
// can have one without the other — a reference to a version directory that
// moved on is declared perfectly and still resolves nowhere.
//
// Each project is installed into its OWN store. A shared one rescues
// references by accident: gpgme's undeclared libgpg-error resolved for months
// because something else in the same closure happened to bring it, and the
// failure only appeared in a closure that had gpgme and not the rescuer.
//
// It reads the Mach-O itself rather than shelling out to otool, which is an
// Xcode tool and absent from the FROM-scratch image this factory builds in.
// This command exists BECAUSE a lab binary answering the same question turned
// out to be two days old with its source lost — a tool built before the fix it
// measures gives verdicts that are plausible and wrong.
