// Publishing an index is a read-modify-write on one mutable tag, and the arch
// jobs — plus the separate darwin workflow — race on it. bottle's per-push
// reconcile confirms its write twice with a settle window between, which catches
// a racer landing just behind it; it cannot catch one that lands after this
// process moved on to the next package. An audit of the live registry found 137
// versions with exactly that damage, 41 missing a linux platform, including
// gnu.org/glibc and kernel.org/linux-headers — the closure of every sovereign
// build.
//
// Running at the END is the point: by then the other publishers have finished,
// so a repair sticks. It is also cheap — one index read per bottle published,
// and nothing written in the common case.
//
// A failure here is reported, not fatal. The bottles are pushed and valid; a
// broken index is repairable by the next run, and failing the whole build over
// it would throw away work that succeeded.
