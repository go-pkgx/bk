// vexReferrer builds the OpenVEX document a bottle carries, or nothing.
//
// This is the step that makes a rebuild SELF-JUSTIFYING. Until now a bottle
// rebuilt for a security fix looked exactly like one rebuilt for any other
// reason: the version string said `_1` and nothing said why. The SBOM says
// what is inside, the provenance says how it was built, and this says which
// vulnerabilities were considered and what was decided about each.
//
// Three outcomes, and the middle one is the point:
//
//	no tree configured, or no file for this project → no referrer, no error
//	a file that exists and does not parse            → ERROR, nothing is published
//	a file that parses                               → the document
//
// A file that exists and cannot be read must not become a silent omission. The
// bottle would be published, look complete, and assert nothing — and the
// absence of a VEX document reads as "nothing was ever found", which is the
// opposite of what a broken record means.
