// TestTheTwoWalksAgree. bk has two closure walks and go-pkgx/bk#224 exists
// because teaching one of them something the other does not know makes
// `bk closure` describe a build the factory would not perform. That defect has
// been reproduced twice since — the logical overrides reached closureOf and
// not closureGraph, and the overlay merge landed in bottle and not in bk — and
// nothing compared the two.
//
// They read the overlay by DIFFERENT rules, deliberately:
//
//	closureOf      takes the UNION of both halves, as two separate recipes,
//	               because a dependency only the overlay declares still has to
//	               be BUILT (closureRecipes).
//	closureGraph   MERGES the overlay over the pantry, as a consumer resolves
//	               (recipefile.LoadMerged).
//
// Different rules can still owe the same answer, and for the RUNTIME closure
// they do — `dependencies` is a mapping, so merging it key by key reaches
// everything the union reaches. This pins that, over the shapes where the two
// rules could part.
