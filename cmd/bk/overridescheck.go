// runOverrides implements `bk overrides`: apply every patch in a directory to a
// pantry checkout and fail if any of them no longer applies.
//
// A patch stops applying when upstream edits the lines its context hangs on, or
// when one of ours does. Nothing about the build says so afterwards: the recipe
// is merely the unpatched one, and it fails for whatever reason the patch
// existed to remove. Measured 2026-09-24 on go-pkgx/packages, 3 of 231
// overrides had stopped — among them the -Werror switch mozilla.org/nss needs,
// whose absence cost two rebuilds and a duplicate fix for a defect that was
// already fixed.
//
// The factory already reports this, at build time, in a log nobody reads until
// something breaks. This is the same fact asked EARLY, by the same applier:
// overrides.Apply, not `git apply`. bk patches with go-gitdiff, and a check
// that shelled out to git would be a second opinion — one that can pass while
// the builder's own applier refuses, which is the failure it is meant to catch.
