// pinChecker is the consuming half of the source mirror: it asks what this URL
// served last time and refuses bytes that disagree.
//
// Three outcomes, and the third is a decision rather than an oversight.
//
//  1. No pin — the first time this URL has been fetched. Recorded by the
//     Mirror hook that runs next. A version bump lands here, because the
//     version is in the URL: a new release asks a question never asked
//     before. That is why there is no --no-pin escape; the case it would
//     serve does not arise.
//
//  2. A pin that differs — the SAME URL serving different bytes. Refused,
//     naming both digests. A re-cut release, a compromised mirror, a hijacked
//     domain: the cases nothing else in this factory would notice.
//
//  3. The store cannot answer. Warned about and allowed through by default,
//     refused under -source-pin-strict. This is the uncomfortable one. An
//     unreachable registry is not evidence of tampering, and the mirror's
//     whole stated contract is that a build must not die because a registry
//     was down — but "cannot read the pin" and "there is no pin" are not the
//     same fact, and treating them alike is how trust-on-first-use quietly
//     becomes trust-every-time. So they are distinguished here, said out
//     loud, and which one is fatal is the operator's choice. bottle's
//     PinnedDigest refuses to conflate them, which is what makes the choice
//     available at all.
