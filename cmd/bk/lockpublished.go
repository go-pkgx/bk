// ⛔ A LOCK PINNED WHAT COULD NOT BE INSTALLED, AND SAID NOTHING.
//
// `bk lock` resolves a version from the recipe's `versions:` block. It never
// asks the registry, so it pins the newest version the recipes can BUILD —
// which by construction runs ahead of what the factory has PUBLISHED.
//
// Measured 2026-10-09 by generating a real lock and running it:
//
//	$ bk lock -platform linux/aarch64 -o curl.lock.hcl curl.se
//	lock: 5 project(s) pinned → curl.lock.hcl
//
//	$ pkgx --lock curl.lock.hcl curl --version      # FROM-scratch container
//	pkgx: no version of curl.se/ca-certs satisfies "=2026.09.25" AND is
//	published for linux/aarch64
//
// Two pins of five — curl.se/ca-certs 2026.09.25 against 2026.8.13
// published, openssl.org 4.0.3 against 4.0.2. The lock's own header promised
// that `pkgx --lock` runs it. Nothing in writing it said otherwise.
//
// # THE TWO USES ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
//
// `bk factory --lock` is about to BUILD these versions, so a pin ahead of the
// registry is exactly right there. `pkgx --lock` can only install what
// exists. One file cannot answer both by accident, so it now answers one of
// them on purpose: `-runnable` pins what is published, the default pins what
// the recipes build, and either way the unpublished pins are NAMED at write
// time rather than discovered by whoever tries to use the file.
//
// # publishedTagFor IS THE ONLY INSTRUMENT THAT CAN ANSWER THIS
//
// Three others look like they can and cannot: the catalogue carries one
// version per project, bottle.VersionsFor spans every platform (our registry's
// tag listing is not per-platform), and `crane ls` shows only the suffixed
// tags while publication may live in the unsuffixed index.
var (
	lockPublishedTagFor = bottle.PublishedTagFor
	lockPickPublished   = bottle.PickVersionFor
	// PickVersionForAll, not PickVersionFor: see publishedVersionFor.
	lockPickPublishedAll = bottle.PickVersionForAll
)

// unpublishedPin is a pin the named platform cannot install.

	// the registry carries none at all — a different situation, and the
	// report says which.
	Published string
}

// unpublishedPins asks, for every pin, whether that exact version is
// published for os/arch.
//
// An error from the registry is NOT silently treated as "published": a lookup
// that could not be made says nothing either way, and reporting it as clean
// is how a check becomes decoration. It is reported as its own line.

//	asked for by =4.0.2 (requested), ^3 (curl.se)
//
// curl.se 8.20 demands openssl ^3; the newest PUBLISHED openssl is 4.0.2. A
// per-project "newest published" is not a closure — it pins a set that cannot
// resolve, under a line claiming pkgx can run it, which is worse than either
// honest answer.
