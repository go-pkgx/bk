// runOrigin implements `bk origin`: what a published bottle says about HOW it
// was built, and whether that is enough to promote it.
//
// ⛔ THE QUESTION IT ANSWERS COULD NOT BE ASKED. go-pkgx/packages#316 needs the
// s390x toolchain to reach ghcr. Generations 0 and 1 both publish only to a
// throwaway loopback registry on the LinuxONE VM — deliberately, because
// bottles driven by the host's compiler must not reach the real registry — so
// promoting anything out of there needs one fact per bottle: was the host's
// toolchain involved. Measured 2026-11-01, the registry could not say:
//
//	$ bk buildenv -platform linux/s390x lz4.org 1.10.0
//	buildenv: lz4.org 1.10.0 (linux/s390x): the provenance records no build
//	environment
//
// An empty build environment is what a bootstrap build produces, since it
// resolves no bottles. It is ALSO what an older bk produced, and what a
// mirrored bottle produces. Three situations, one silence — and a gate cannot
// read a silence.
//
// ⛔ SO `-promotable` REQUIRES AN EXPLICIT "0" AND TREATS EVERY OTHER ANSWER AS
// NO. Not because unknown bottles are suspect, but because the failure
// directions are not symmetric: refusing to promote a good bottle costs a
// rebuild, and promoting a host-built one puts an unpinned Ubuntu compiler's
// output in the production registry under our signature. The default answer
// to "may I?" is no.
