// runSonames implements `bk sonames`: which shared library does a set of
// PUBLISHED bottles need that none of them provides.
//
// `bk builder` answers this for a STAGED tree, and that is the right question
// for a rootfs. It is not the right question for a registry, because the two
// are not the same set and cannot be: a seed order is a BUILD order, not a
// coexisting one. Measured on go-pkgx/packages' 78 — cmake.org wants
// curl.se `>=5<8.13` and rust-lang.org/cargo wants `8`, and no published
// version satisfies both, so there is no tree that holds them all.
//
// So each bottle is unpacked ON ITS OWN and the two sets are unioned. That
// answers "which soname does NOBODY here provide", which is the shape of the
// defect this exists for: a bottle built on a host that HAS libselinux links
// it, and nothing in this factory ships it. It does NOT answer "does each
// bottle's DECLARED closure suffice" — that is `bk undeclared`, and it is a
// stricter and more expensive question.
//
// Reported, never fatal, like the staged-tree census: a sweep that can fail a
// pipeline is one nobody runs.
