// runLock implements `bk lock`: resolve a set (or a list of projects) to the
// exact versions it means TODAY, and write them down.
//
// # WHY A MANIFEST IS NOT ENOUGH, which is not our observation
//
// Guix's manual states it plainly: "to reproduce a profile bit-for-bit,
// manifests alone might not be enough" — the same names resolve differently
// against a different package set, so a manifest needs the channel revisions
// beside it. Spack names the two halves: an environment from `spack.yaml` has
// "the same root specs... may concretize differently", one from `spack.lock`
// has "the same concrete specs".
//
// `members` (go-pkgx/bk#294) gave this factory the abstract half. This is the
// concrete one.
//
// # AND IT MATTERS MORE HERE THAN IN GUIX
//
// A Guix manifest resolves deterministically once the channel revision is
// pinned: the version is in the checkout. A pkgx recipe's `versions:` spec
// asks GitHub for tags AT RESOLVE TIME, so pinning the pantry revision is not
// enough — the same pantry commit resolves `gnu.org/bash` to whatever the
// newest tag is the day you ask. The resolved version has to be written down
// or it is not pinned at all.
//
// # WHAT THIS PINS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
//
// It pins the NAMES, the VERSIONS and a per-project SPEC HASH (see specHash),
// and records the pantry and overlay revisions that produced them. The spec
// hash covers the INPUTS — platform, version, parsed recipe, dependencies —
// which is what Nix's derivation hash and Spack's spec hash cover too.
//
// It does not pin the OUTPUT bytes. A bottle digest would, and `bottle` can
// verify a digest but has no exported way to be asked for one; and a lock
// taken before anything is built has no output to name. Saying so is better
// than a lock that quietly guarantees less than a reader assumes.
