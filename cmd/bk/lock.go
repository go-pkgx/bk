// runLock implements `bk lock`: resolve a set (or a list of projects) to the
// exact versions it means TODAY, and write them down.
//
// # WHY A MANIFEST IS NOT ENOUGH, which is not our observation
//
// Guix's manual states it plainly: "to reproduce a profile bit-for-bit,
// manifests alone might not be enough" — the same names resolve differently
// against a different package set, so a manifest needs the channel revisions
// beside it. Spack names the two halves: an environment from `spack.yaml` has
// "the same root specs... may concretize differently", one from `spack.lock`
// has "the same concrete specs".
//
// `members` (go-pkgx/bk#294) gave this factory the abstract half. This is the
// concrete one.
//
// # AND IT MATTERS MORE HERE THAN IN GUIX
//
// A Guix manifest resolves deterministically once the channel revision is
// pinned: the version is in the checkout. A pkgx recipe's `versions:` spec
// asks GitHub for tags AT RESOLVE TIME, so pinning the pantry revision is not
// enough — the same pantry commit resolves `gnu.org/bash` to whatever the
// newest tag is the day you ask. The resolved version has to be written down
// or it is not pinned at all.
//
// # WHAT THIS PINS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
//
// It pins the NAMES and the VERSIONS, and records the pantry and overlay
// revisions that produced them. It does not pin the bytes: a bottle's digest
// would do that, and `bottle` can verify a digest but has no exported way to
// ask for one. That is the next half, and saying so is better than a lock
// that quietly guarantees less than a reader assumes.
