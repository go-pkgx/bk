// expandSets replaces any root that is a SET with the packages it names.
//
// A set is an ordinary recipe carrying `members` — see pantry.Recipe.Members
// for why it is a recipe and not a new kind of file. Expanding at the ROOT is
// what makes it cost nothing downstream: the dependency walk, the topological
// order, `bk factory`, the publisher and the installer all keep working on
// discrete projects and never learn the word.
//
// Nested: a set may name another set, because the alternative is that the
// first person who wants "the toolchain plus these three" copies the
// toolchain's list. Depth is bounded and a cycle is REPORTED rather than
// followed — a set that contains itself is a mistake someone should see, and
// silently de-duplicating it would hide the day two sets were written to
// include each other.
//
// Order is the file's, not the map's: Go randomises map iteration, and a
// closure whose roots arrive in a different order every run produces a
// different feedback arc set inside a cycle — which is a build order that
// changes for no reason. Members are sorted.
