//
// Named after `guix weather`, which answers the same question — "the fraction
// of all the packages for which substitutes are available on the server", with
// a repeatable --system — and which we did not have. That absence cost two
// silent days: the base toolchain pins gawk ~5.3, only darwin/aarch64 had a
// bottle for it, and darwin/x86-64 could not assemble a tool environment at
// all. Every build there failed naming the package being built, never the
// toolchain, until somebody happened to dispatch one.
//
// It asks PickVersionForAll, which is what the RESOLVER asks. Two proxies were
// tried first and both lied:
//
//   - counting `--<os>-<arch>` image tags: the convention is not universal,
//     and projects that install perfectly carry none. It invented eight gaps.
//   - VersionsFor: the registry's tags span platforms, so gnupg.org answers 22
//     for both arches while being installable on one. It hid the real gap.
//
// A refusal from the resolver is the fact. Anything that merely resembles the
// question measures itself.
