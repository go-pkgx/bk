// Cargo's `--locked` and npm's `ci` both exist because a lock nobody verifies

// resolution disagree. Spack keeps the same shape from the other end — it
// reuses a lockfile's concrete specs unless a run forces re-concretization.
//

//
//	a version that moved          — the ordinary case, and the one a
//	                                version-only lock could also catch
//	a SPEC HASH that moved while  — a recipe edited UNDER a pin. This is the
//	the version did not             case the spec hash exists for, and the
//	                                only one nothing else here can see
//	a project that left or joined — the closure's SHAPE changed
//	a revision that differs       — said, never fatal on its own: a pantry
//	                                can move without moving any answer, and
//	                                calling that drift would make the check
