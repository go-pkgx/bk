// auditStagedSonames reports every shared library a staged tree NEEDS and does
// not contain.
//
// The sovereign rootfs has nothing underneath it, so a NEEDED soname that no
// staged bottle provides is a binary that cannot start — and it says so only
// when something runs it, which is deep inside a build and attributed to
// whatever happened to run first. The s390x second generation met this twice
// in a row, on two different tools, a full build apart:
//
//	mkdir: error while loading shared libraries: libselinux.so.1
//	sed:   error while loading shared libraries: libselinux.so.1
//
// Both came from the same cause — a bottle built on a host that HAS libselinux,
// whose configure auto-detects it — and each cost a round trip to a runner to
// learn the next name. The tree can answer the whole question at once, before
// a single build starts.
//
// REPORTED, never fatal. A tree can legitimately carry an ELF for another
// purpose, and the staging step's job is to stage; refusing here would turn a
// useful census into a gate nobody can land a change past. The build that
// follows is the verdict.
