// Package spec computes the identity of a build: what a bottle IS, as
// opposed to what it is called.
//
// # WHOSE IDEA THIS IS
//
// Spack's, exactly. Its packaging guide states what goes into a spec hash:
// "build, link, and run dependencies all affect the hash of Spack packages
// (along with sha256 sums of patches and archives used to build the package,
// and a canonical hash of the package.py recipes)".
//
// The part worth copying is the last clause. Pinning versions catches an
// upstream that moved; hashing the RECIPE catches the other half — a build
// script edited in the pantry resolves to the same version and produces a
// different package. Versions alone call those two builds the same, which is
// the thing an identity exists not to do.
//
// # WHAT "CANONICAL" MEANS HERE, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
//
// Spack canonicalises package.py's AST, dropping comments and docstrings.
// Here the recipe is parsed YAML or HCL, and the hash is taken over the
// PARSED value re-serialised as JSON with sorted keys. So reformatting a
// recipe, reordering its mapping keys or rewriting its comments does not
// move the hash, and changing what it says does.
//
// It is NOT a hash of the file. A recipe whose meaning is identical through
// two different spellings hashes alike, and that is deliberate: an identity
// that moved on whitespace would be re-taken until it stopped meaning
// anything.
//
// # WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN cmd/zbk
//
// It was written for `zbk lock` and sat in `package main`, where the BUILD
// could not reach it — so the factory shipped 42 756 bottles with no identity
// at all while a correct one sat two directories away (go-zpkg/zbk#410). A
// hash that only one command can compute is a hash the product does not have.

// Domains are the hash's first line, and two different questions must not
// share one.
//
// ⛔ A DOMAIN IS NOT DECORATION. `lock` identifies a dependency by its own
// SPEC HASH, because it holds the whole closure's recipes; a BUILD identifies
// one by its resolved store PREFIX, because that is what it has and because a
// hashed prefix already carries the dependency's identity — the same trick
// Nix uses when a derivation references its inputs by store path. Those are
// different functions of different inputs. Hashing them under one domain
// would let a value computed for one be compared against the other, and the
// comparison would be meaningless rather than wrong-looking.

//
// A project can be described by the pantry AND by our overlay, and both are
// passed because they say different things. The hash covers both, in the
// order the closure reads them: a hash taken over one half would describe a
// different graph from the one beside it.
//
// # depIDs
//
// Already formatted by the caller as "<name> <identity>", sorted, because
// what identifies a dependency differs by question — see Domain.
