// gnu.org/grep spends thirteen lines explaining why it names itself as a build
// dependency.

// most projects are still unified diffs and must not change behaviour because

// labour. For a project upstream carries, `overrides/` fixes the BUILD and the
// overlay fixes what a consumer RESOLVES, and letting the overlay win here
// would silently build something other than what the overrides say. For a
// project upstream does not carry, there is nothing to fall back from: the
// overlay's copy is the only recipe there is.
//
// It replaces a directory of patches that CREATED those recipes. A patch that
// adds a whole package.yml is not an override of anybody's recipe — it is a
// recipe of ours — and writing it twice, once as a diff for the builder and
// once as HCL for the consumer, is the two-halves defect carried deliberately.

// bottle.recipeDoc exactly, which is what a consumer resolves.
//
// Not the overlay preferred whole. That was right while every overlay entry
// was a full copy of an upstream recipe, and it broke the day they stopped
// being: go-pkgx/pantry-overlay reduced its 183 entries to the keys they
// change (go-pkgx/bottle#103), so reading one on its own gives a fragment.
// Measured before this existed — `bk closure --build curl.se` went from 54
// projects to 8, because the entry says `dependencies` and nothing else, and
// the walk never saw upstream's build dependencies at all.
//
// bottle merges and bk did not, which is the two-halves defect one more time:
// a change landed in the half a consumer reads and the builder's own reader
// kept the old rule.
//
// The set is the second half of the same lesson. The overlay carries 183
// projects and the overrides describe 206, 178 of which edit a dependency, so
// a walk that took the overlay's view for the OTHERS read them unoverridden.
// Measured 2026-09-28 on a pristine pantry: `bk closure --build
// rsync.samba.org` lists gnu.org/libidn2 without --overlay and not with it,
// because that dependency exists only in our override and rsync is one of the
// six such projects the overlay does not carry. The order that misses a
// provider is the order the seed builds.
