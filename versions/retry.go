// httpDoRetrying repeats a request whose host failed to answer.

// Resolving a version is one GET against whatever host the recipe names, and
// those hosts are not all well. Seven x.org recipes were lost in a single batch
// to `dial tcp 131.252.210.176:443: i/o timeout` — and that host is not down:
// three consecutive requests to it answered 200 in 8.2s, 200 in 2.4s, then
// timed out. Giving a flaky host exactly one chance reports our own bad luck as
// a recipe with no candidate version.
//
// A response that ARRIVED is returned as-is, whatever its status, except the
// two shapes that mean "not now": 429 and 5xx. A 404 is an answer.
