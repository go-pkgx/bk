// Package support answers a question a vulnerability database cannot: is the
// version we publish on an upstream release line that is still supported?
//
// ⛔ END-OF-LIFE IS NOT A CVE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS EXISTS. OSV
// answers "what is known to be wrong with this version". A line that upstream
// has stopped supporting has, by definition, nothing known about it yet — and
// never will, because nobody is looking and no fix is coming. `bk vulnfetch`
// and the daily sweep are structurally blind to it: they can return a clean
// zero for a package whose upstream stopped issuing fixes years ago.
//
// Measured 2026-10-29 against the registry: it publishes openssl 3.2, 3.3,
// 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 4.0. Of those, 3.2 and 3.3 were already out of support,
// 3.4 went out on 2026-10-22 — a week earlier — and 3.6 goes out on
// 2026-11-01. A `^3` constraint takes the newest 3.x, which is 3.6: so the
// default resolution was three days from an unsupported line while 3.5, the
// LTS supported to 2030, sat in the registry unused. Nothing in the CVE lane
// could say so.
//
// # The source, and the field that lies
//
// endoflife.date's v1 API (schema 1.2.1) returns, per product, a list of
// release cycles. The fields that matter are `isEol` and `eolFrom`.
//
// ⛔ `isMaintained` IS NOT THE ANSWER, and reading it would invert the
// verdict on the worst case. From the live response for openssl:
//
//	{"name":"1.1.1","isEol":true,"eolFrom":"2023-09-11","isMaintained":true}
//	{"name":"3.0",  "isEol":true,"eolFrom":"2026-09-07","isMaintained":true}
//
// Both lines have been out of support for a while, and both say
// `isMaintained: true` — it reflects the PAID extended support openssl sells
// (the product's own labels call it "Premium support"). A check reading that
// field would report 1.1.1 as healthy, which is exactly the bottle this fleet
// has 32 of.
//
// ⛔ AN ABSENT DATE IS NOT A DISTANT ONE. A cycle may carry `eolFrom: null`,
// which means nobody has published a date — not that the line is supported
// forever. It is reported as UNKNOWN and never as healthy, because the
// alternative is a silence that reads like an answer.
//
// # How the others do it
//
// Yocto has no equivalent: its CVE handling is identity plus a database, which
// is the half this complements. Wolfi gets closest with the
// `fix-not-planned` event, which its own documentation reserves for
// end-of-life packages and says "should never be used on supported software" —
// but that is a decision recorded per advisory, after somebody noticed. This
// asks the question before there is an advisory to decide about.
