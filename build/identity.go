// concreteOf describes what this build IS, in the form the bottle carries and
// a reader can verify: `bottle.Concrete`.
//
// ⛔⛔ THERE IS ONE DEFINITION OF A BUILD'S IDENTITY AND IT LIVES IN `bottle`.
// This function used to compute a second one, `spec.Hash(spec.DomainBuild,…)`,
// and put its short form in the install prefix. That was wrong in a way that
// would only have surfaced after publishing: `bottle.VerifySpec` checks that
// the spec on a manifest hashes to the hash in the tag, so a tag carrying our
// number and an annotation carrying bottle's would have made every bottle we
// publish fail its own verification — and the message says "the bottle does
// not match its own description", which reads as tampering.
//
// It was also the weaker of the two. A hash is only worth what a reader can
// recompute, and nothing published carries the inputs to `spec.Hash`: the
// annotation holds the platform, the resolved closure and a recipe DIGEST, so
// `Concrete.Hash()` can be recomputed from the bottle and ours could not.
// `spec` remains what it was written for, `zbk lock`, whose domain string is
// frozen into every lock file in existence.
//
// ⛔ DEPENDENCIES ARE IDENTIFIED BY THEIR OWN HASH, WHICH MAKES THIS MERKLE.
// The hash comes out of the resolved prefix — `…/openssl.org/v3.6.4-h<hash>`
// — so hashing the edge carries the dependency's whole identity with it,
// transitively, the way a Nix derivation references its inputs by store path.
// A dependency still installed at an unhashed `v<version>` contributes an
// empty hash: that edge degrades to version-level precision and no further,
// and it repairs itself as the registry is rebuilt. Said out loud rather than
// hidden, because a hash is only as sharp as what it is taken over.
