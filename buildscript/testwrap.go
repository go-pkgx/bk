// TestWrapOptions carries what a recipe's test: block needs around it.
//
// The schema calls the test "a post-build sanity test run in a fresh sandbox",
// and the sandbox is the whole point: it answers "does what we PUBLISHED
// work", which is a different question from "did the build succeed". So this
// deliberately does NOT reuse WrapOptions.
//
// What a build script has and a test script must not:
//
//	CFLAGS/LDFLAGS/rpath  a test may COMPILE — 260 recipes' do — but against
//	                      the package as shipped. A flag set that made the
//	                      artefact link would mask a bottle whose own headers
//	                      or rpath are wrong, which is the thing worth
//	                      catching. The compiler itself is supplied; the
//	                      build's flags are not.
//	CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH     the whole store (go-pkgx/bk#164). A test that found
//	                      a header there would be finding it by accident.
//	$SRCROOT / the build  the sources are gone by then, and a test that reads
//	                      tree                  them is testing the tree and
//	                      not the package.
//
// What it keeps is close to what a user has: the package itself, whatever the
// recipe declares under test.dependencies, the recipe's own fixture files, a
// fresh HOME and an empty directory to work in — plus a compiler when the
// test's own script calls one.

	// Package is the pkgspec of the package UNDER TEST, and it must name an

	// still published would otherwise test 5.3.0 and report on the wrong
	// bytes — a green result about a build that never happened.
	Package string
	// Deps are the recipe's test.dependencies, already reduced for the target

	// Compiler asks for one in the test environment.
	//
	// The first version of this file said a test may not have a compiler,
	// because "a consumer installing this package gets none". Measured
	// against pantry 2df061b with `bk tools --scope test --all`, that is
	// wrong: 260 recipes' tests call a compiler (cc 193, c++ 38, gcc 13,
	// g++ 7, clang 6, clang++ 6 — 260 distinct, not the sum of 263, because
	// three call two of them), and only 6 declare llvm.org. A recipe's test
	// compiling a five-line program against the headers it just shipped IS
	// the convention here — zlib.net's is `cc test.c -lz` — and a sandbox
	// that refuses would have reported 260 false failures.
	//
	// Asked per test rather than always, from the rendered script's own
	// command set, so the 1500-odd tests that compile nothing do not install
	// a compiler to not use it.

	BashPath string        // shebang interpreter (default /bin/bash)
	Host     target.Target // where we run — drives TMPDIR
	// ShimDir holds bk's compiler shims (cc, gcc, c++, g++ and their
	// triple-prefixed spellings), materialised by the caller with
	// WriteLibexecFor. It is prepended to PATH in a scratch rootfs so a test
	// that calls `cc` by name — which 194 of the pantry's do — gets the
	// sovereign driver rather than a bare clang with no libc.
	//

	// putting the flags in $CC, which is what it used to do and what reaches

// that costs: of nine reported failures, FIVE never ran a line of their test
// block. invisible-island.net/ncurses wants github.com/tmux/tmux ^3 as a
// test dependency and no s390x tmux exists anywhere; gnu.org/readline's
// closure needs libCNS.so, which pkgx's soname map does not name. Neither is
// a bottle that does not work, and calling them failures would file bugs
// against packages for an incomplete registry.
//
// 69 is sysexits' EX_UNAVAILABLE, which is what happened. A test that exits
// 69 on its own would be read as this — and would be saying very nearly the
// same thing, which is why the collision is tolerable where an arbitrary
// number would not be.

// The trace goes to stderr, and a test that captures stderr captures it:

//
// gnu.org/glibc reported a broken iconv on nothing but that. Measured on
// pantry 2df061b: 31 of the 1897 recipes with a test block capture stderr
// into a substitution, and every one of them would read its own trace.
//
// BASH_XTRACEFD would have kept both — the trace on a descriptor `2>&1`
// cannot reach — and mvdan.cc/sh ignores it, measured rather than assumed.
//
// So the trace is dropped. A missing trace makes a failure slower to read;
// a contaminated capture makes a WORKING package report FAIL, and a wrong
// answer is worse than a slow one. The generated script stays on disk beside
// the sandbox, which is where the commands can still be read.

// The file comment above says a test gets the compiler and not the build's
// flags, because a flag set that made the artefact link would mask a bottle
// whose own headers or rpath are wrong. That is still true, and this does not
// weaken it: what is emitted here is the sysroot — where libc's headers and
// crt files are — and nothing the recipe chose. No recipe CFLAGS, no rpath,
// no CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH. A test must be able to produce a binary at all; it
// must not be handed the flags that made the artefact link.
//
// The reasoning the file was written with assumed a DISTRIBUTION, where the
// system supplies libc and withholding the build's flags leaves a working
// compiler. In the sovereign generation the rootfs is scratch and nothing
// supplies it, so withholding meant the test could not compile anything —
// and the assertion failed for the sandbox rather than for the package.
//
// Guarded at RUN TIME on the absence of a system header, not at generation
// time, for two reasons. The generator does not know what rootfs the script
// will run in — the same bk builds on a distribution and inside the chroot.
// And a distribution's script stays byte-for-byte what it was: the branch is
// not taken, so nothing about the 260 recipes that compile today changes.
//
// # SETTING $CC REACHED ALMOST NOTHING, AND THAT WAS MEASURABLE BEFOREHAND
//
// The first version of this exported CC and CXX and stopped there. Measured
// afterwards, on the second full sovereign generation: 16 of 23 test failures
// were a missing C header, and every one of them called the compiler BY NAME.

// Those are command names in command position. Not one of the 194 reads $CC.
// So the export was a fix that could not work, and the count that says so was
// available from a command in this repository before it was written.
//
// The build side had solved this years earlier and said why, in
// buildscript/libexec.go: "a recipe may call `cc` or `gcc` DIRECTLY, ignoring
// $CC". The same shims go on the test's PATH, pointed at the same $BK_CC. The
// test still gets the SYSROOT and nothing the recipe chose, so the rule this
