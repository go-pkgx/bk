// TestWrapOptions carries what a recipe's test: block needs around it.
//
// The schema calls the test "a post-build sanity test run in a fresh sandbox",
// and the sandbox is the whole point: it answers "does what we PUBLISHED
// work", which is a different question from "did the build succeed". So this
// deliberately does NOT reuse WrapOptions.
//
// What a build script has and a test script must not:
//
//	CFLAGS/LDFLAGS/rpath  a test may COMPILE — 260 recipes' do — but against
//	                      the package as shipped. A flag set that made the
//	                      artefact link would mask a bottle whose own headers
//	                      or rpath are wrong, which is the thing worth
//	                      catching. The compiler itself is supplied; the
//	                      build's flags are not.
//	CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH     the whole store (go-pkgx/bk#164). A test that found
//	                      a header there would be finding it by accident.
//	$SRCROOT / the build  the sources are gone by then, and a test that reads
//	                      tree                  them is testing the tree and
//	                      not the package.
//
// What it keeps is close to what a user has: the package itself, whatever the
// recipe declares under test.dependencies, the recipe's own fixture files, a
// fresh HOME and an empty directory to work in — plus a compiler when the
// test's own script calls one.
type TestWrapOptions struct {
	UserScript string // the test node, already rendered by Generate
	// Package is the pkgspec of the package UNDER TEST, and it must name an
	// exact version. `bk test gnu.org/gawk` after building 5.4.1 with 5.3.0
	// still published would otherwise test 5.3.0 and report on the wrong
	// bytes — a green result about a build that never happened.
	Package string
	// Deps are the recipe's test.dependencies, already reduced for the target
	// and rendered as pkgspecs. They are a SEPARATE map from build and runtime
	// dependencies: a test may need a fixture generator or a diff tool that
	// the package itself must not carry.
	Deps []string
	// Compiler asks for one in the test environment.
	//
	// The first version of this file said a test may not have a compiler,
	// because "a consumer installing this package gets none". Measured
	// against pantry 2df061b with `bk tools --scope test --all`, that is
	// wrong: 260 recipes' tests call a compiler (cc 193, c++ 38, gcc 13,
	// g++ 7, clang 6, clang++ 6 — 260 distinct, not the sum of 263, because
	// three call two of them), and only 6 declare llvm.org. A recipe's test
	// compiling a five-line program against the headers it just shipped IS
	// the convention here — zlib.net's is `cc test.c -lz` — and a sandbox
	// that refuses would have reported 260 false failures.
	//
	// Asked per test rather than always, from the rendered script's own
	// command set, so the 1500-odd tests that compile nothing do not install
	// a compiler to not use it.
	Compiler bool
	Home     string        // a fresh HOME, created by the script
	Sandbox  string        // the empty directory the test runs in
	PkgxDir  string        // $PKGX_DIR, so the eval resolves where the build published
	PkgxBin  string        // path to the pkgx binary
	BashPath string        // shebang interpreter (default /bin/bash)
	Host     target.Target // where we run — drives TMPDIR

// EnvFailExit is the status the test script exits with when `pkgx +…` could
// not assemble the environment — as opposed to the test itself failing.
//
// The two were one for a while, and the s390x seed's first sweep shows what
// that costs: of nine reported failures, FIVE never ran a line of their test
// block. invisible-island.net/ncurses wants github.com/tmux/tmux ^3 as a
// test dependency and no s390x tmux exists anywhere; gnu.org/readline's
// closure needs libCNS.so, which pkgx's soname map does not name. Neither is
// a bottle that does not work, and calling them failures would file bugs
// against packages for an incomplete registry.
//
// 69 is sysexits' EX_UNAVAILABLE, which is what happened. A test that exits
// 69 on its own would be read as this — and would be saying very nearly the
// same thing, which is why the collision is tolerable where an arbitrary
// number would not be.

// WrapTest renders the runnable script for a recipe's test: block.
//
// NO `set -x`, and the first version of this had it with a reason that was
// right about diagnosis and wrong about correctness.
//
// The trace goes to stderr, and a test that captures stderr captures it:
//
//	out=$("{{prefix}}/bin/iconv" --version 2>&1 | head -1)
//	→ out='+ /…/bin/iconv --version'
//
// gnu.org/glibc reported a broken iconv on nothing but that. Measured on
// pantry 2df061b: 31 of the 1897 recipes with a test block capture stderr
// into a substitution, and every one of them would read its own trace.
//
// BASH_XTRACEFD would have kept both — the trace on a descriptor `2>&1`
// cannot reach — and mvdan.cc/sh ignores it, measured rather than assumed.
//
// So the trace is dropped. A missing trace makes a failure slower to read;
// a contaminated capture makes a WORKING package report FAIL, and a wrong
// answer is worse than a slow one. The generated script stays on disk beside
// the sandbox, which is where the commands can still be read.
