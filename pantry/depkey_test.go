// bk reads the UPSTREAM pantry — a third-party checkout — takes these keys
// out of it and concatenates them into a URL (OCIClient.repository) and a
// filesystem path (InstallFor builds <dir>/<project>/v<version>, written to).
// bottle validates at both of those; `git grep ValidateProjectName` in bk
// returns nothing, so until now nothing here constrained the shape at all.

// The constraint lives in the authoritative schema rather than in Go because
// that is what this package calls authoritative, and because the HCL2
// front-end decodes into the same Recipe and would otherwise need its own
// copy of the rule.

// ⛔ Measured before it was added: the upstream pantry's 1929 recipes carry
// 7410 dependency-map keys across both levels, and the pattern accepts every
// one. A constraint on the authoritative schema that rejected something real
// would not be a tightening, it would be an outage.
