// Supports reports whether a recipe's `platforms:` admits one target.
//
// The field was parsed and read by nobody. 81 recipes in the pantry declare a
// platforms: that excludes darwin — elfutils.org, systemd.io, x.org/xserver,
// kernel.org/linux, github.com/vmware/tdnf among them — and every consumer
// treated them as darwin candidates: `bk factory` on darwin attempted them and
// collected the failures, and `bk depgaps` ranked THEIR unmet dependencies as
// darwin gaps, which is how rpm.org/rpm and opensuse.org/libsolv came to sit in
// a darwin/aarch64 ranking.
//
// Honouring it removes only work that cannot succeed. Measured against the
// published registry: of those 81, seven do have a darwin bottle
// (freedesktop.org/libbsd, github.com/containerd/nerdctl,
// github.com/containers/buildah, github.com/rui314/mold, gnupg.org/v2.5,
// google.com/fullycapable, mercure.rocks) and all seven are MIRRORS —
// platform-tags=0, upstream's layer format. Our factory has never built one.
//
// Three spellings are accepted, because the pantry uses all three:
//
//	platforms: linux                        # a bare string
//	platforms: [linux]                      # a list of OS names
//	platforms: [linux/x86-64, linux/aarch64]  # os/arch slugs
//
// An absent field means every platform. An entry naming only an OS admits every
// arch of it; an os/arch slug admits exactly that pair.

// platformEntries flattens the field's three spellings into a list of entries.
