// Package vuln answers one question for a pkgx project: under what name will a
// vulnerability database recognise it?
//
// There are two answers and they rank. Most projects name a repository or an
// ecosystem themselves, and versions.Identities plus FromProjectName read it
// (the DERIVED answer). The rest name nothing but an upstream host, and for
// those a human writes the name down once, in a table (the DECLARED answer).
// Declared wins, because it exists only where the derivation was judged wrong
// or absent.
//
// ⛔ TWO CENSUSES, TWO CORPORA, DO NOT MIX THEM. An offline census over the
// pantry AND the overlay — 1908 recipes — counting build-dependency hints as
// an ecosystem, found 1005 in an ecosystem, 1506 naming a repository, 302 with
// only an upstream host and 14 with nothing. `bk vulnid` measures something
// narrower and more useful: only what a QUERY can be built from. On the cached
// pantry alone, 1563 recipes, it reports 1241 derived and 322 with no identity.
// Neither number is wrong and neither substitutes for the other.
//
// # How the others do it
//
// Yocto puts the name in the recipe and defaults it: CVE_PRODUCT is ${BPN}
// unless a recipe overrides it, and the documentation gives both reasons an
// override is needed — a product whose CVE name differs from its recipe name
// (`CVE_PRODUCT = "oracle_berkeley_db berkeley_db"`, note the TWO names), and a
// name that is not specific enough:
//
//	Sometimes the product name is not specific enough, for example "tar"
//	has been matching CVEs for the GNU tar package and also the node-tar
//	node.js extension. To avoid this problem, use the vendor name as a
//	prefix. The syntax for this is: CVE_PRODUCT = "vendor:package"
//
// That is the defect measured here on 2026-10-11 from the other end: a bare
// `openssl:3.5.7` CPE query returned 27 CVEs, four of them from 2009, because
// every openssl criterion in the answer reads `openssl:*` with no upper bound.
// So a CPE name in this table is REFUSED unless it carries its vendor.
//
// Wolfi keeps the other half — which vulnerabilities a package has, and what
// was decided about each — in a separate `<package>.advisories.yaml` per
// package, as an ordered list of timestamped events (`detection`, `fixed` with
// a `fixed-version`, `false-positive-determination`, …). This table is NOT
// that: it holds identity only. Mixing the two would mean editing a file that
// names 1908 projects every time one vulnerability is triaged.
