// Why bother, when the records are already structured? Because a record only
// this fleet can read is a record that costs every consumer a re-triage. VEX
// exists so that "we are not affected, and here is the machine-readable reason"
// travels with the artefact. The spec is explicit about the cost of the prose
// alternative: an `impact_statement` "breaks VEX automation and
// interoperability", so the label is what gets emitted and the prose rides
// along beside it.
//
// Field names, requiredness and the two fixed vocabularies are from
// openvex/spec OPENVEX-SPEC.md as read on 2026-10-11.

// VEXContext is the context URL for the spec version this encoder writes. The
// spec says an omitted version "defaults to v0.0.1", so writing it explicitly
// is not decoration: without it a consumer reads a v0.2.0 document as the
// oldest one.

//
// The hash is what makes the statement checkable rather than merely plausible.
// A purl names a version; a digest names the bytes, and it is the same digest
