// An advisory file is the other half of this package: not which NAME to ask a
// database under (that is Table), but what the answer was and what we decided
// about it.
//
// # The shape is Wolfi's, and the reason is that a state is not enough
//
// Wolfi keeps one `<package>.advisories.yaml` per package, and each advisory in
// it is an ordered list of TIMESTAMPED EVENTS rather than a current state:
// `detection`, then `fixed` carrying the version that fixed it, or
// `false-positive-determination` carrying why. The measured curl file holds 59
// advisories and 71 events — so most have one event and some have three, which
// is precisely the history a single `status:` field would have thrown away.
//
// OpenVEX says the same thing from the other end: `timestamp` is a REQUIRED
// field of a document and the statement's own timestamp is "the time at which
// the information expressed in the Statement was known to be true". A statement
// about a vulnerability with no time on it cannot be superseded, because
// nothing says which of two contradictory statements is the later one.
//
// So: events, each with a timestamp, and the LAST one decides. An advisory with
// no events is refused rather than read as "nothing is known": that is what the
// `detection` event is for, and it is one line.
//
// # Why not in the recipe
//
// Yocto does put the identity in the recipe (`CVE_PRODUCT`) and this fleet
// follows it for identity. The FINDINGS are different: they change without the
// recipe changing, they arrive from a database rather than from upstream, and
// there are many per project. A table naming 1908 projects, edited on every
// triage, is a merge conflict generator; and this repository's own override
// mechanism is a set of `git diff` patches against upstream recipes, of which 3
// of 231 had silently stopped applying when last measured.

// AdvisoryVersion is the only advisory-file schema version ParseAdvisories
// accepts. Refused rather than best-effort, for the reason TableVersion is.

	// ⛔ WITHOUT IT A DECISION OUTLIVES ITS SUBJECT. A purl names a version,
	// so the OpenVEX document we publish is a statement ABOUT a version —
	// while a `false-positive-determination` carries none and therefore
	// reads as "not affected, full stop". Determine that for 1.0.0, publish
	// 2.0.0, and the same record re-emits `not_affected` about a version
	// nobody examined. Practitioner guidance on VEX is explicit that a
	// "not affected" goes stale when the component changes and that a gate
	// should re-check rather than treat it as permanent; an unjustified or
	// stale one is worse than issuing nothing, because it stops the reader
	// looking. See go-pkgx/bk#340.
	//
	// ⛔ A RECORD THAT NAMES NO VERSION NOW REACHES NOTHING. The emitter
	// refuses to restate `not_affected` or `fixed` — the two statuses that

	// and downgrades the statement to `under_investigation` instead. So
