// REAL DEFECT. On 2026-09-29 zlib.net 1.3.2 was built on the s390x seed VM
// before and after it was replaced:
//
//	every FILE byte-identical, 14 entries either side
//	directories   0755 → 0775      the hosts' umasks, 0022 and 0002
//
// `normalise` in this package fixes that class now, citing
// reproducible-builds.org. But the finding came from a comparison nobody has
// run since, and a class of defect that is only ever found by hand is a class
// that comes back. Two digests that differ say "differ"; this says WHAT.
//
// ⛔ IT CLASSIFIES, AND THE CLASS IS THE POINT. "The bottles differ" sends
// someone to diff two tarballs. "Three directories differ in MODE ONLY" names
// the umask, and "one file differs in CONTENT" names the compiler or an
// embedded path or a timestamp — different problems with different fixes.
