# bk — a pure-Go brewkit

`bk` is a from-scratch, `CGO_ENABLED=0` reimplementation of [pkgx](https://pkgx.sh)'s
build tool [brewkit](https://github.com/pkgxdev/brewkit) (originally Deno/TypeScript
with Ruby + `patchelf` helpers). It reads a pantry `package.yml`, builds the package
in a pkgx environment, relocates the install tree, and packages a bottle.

The reference brewkit is a *native* build tool — everything pivots on the host it
runs on being the thing it builds for. `bk` is **Target ≠ Host by design**: the
build target (platform/arch/triple) is a first-class value, so cross-compilation —
notably **Windows PE bottles built on a linux/darwin host** — is a supported path
rather than a retrofit.

## Status

Early. Implemented and 100%-covered so far:

| package  | what it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `target` | the single source of truth for the build **target** vs the **host** (`BREWKIT_TARGET` / `--platform`), incl. the llvm-mingw Windows cross triples |
| `config` | the build workspace layout, keyed on the target so a cross build never collides with a native one |
| `schema` | an authoritative **JSON Schema** for `package.yml` — there is no official one; this is derived from libpkgx's parser and validated against the entire pkgxdev/pantry corpus (0 rejections over 1890 recipes) |
| `pantry` | parses + schema-validates a `package.yml` into a shared `Recipe` |
| `pantry/hcl` | an **HCL2 front-end** — a `package.hcl` decodes into the *same* `Recipe` via the same schema, so a recipe written in HCL2 yields an identical build |
| `fixup`  | post-build relocatability: `.pc`/`.cmake` path rewriting, libtool `.la` cleanup, `lib64→lib`, single-dir header flattening, and a **pure-Go ELF RUNPATH rewriter** (`debug/elf`, no `patchelf`). A Windows target skips all POSIX relocation. |
| `cmd/bk` | `bk target` prints the resolved target; `bk fixup <prefix>` runs the relocation pipeline |

Roadmap: dependency-closure hydration (reusing
[`go-pkgx/bottle`](https://github.com/go-pkgx/bottle)), build-script generation,
source fetch/extract, Mach-O relocation, and bottle packaging.

### Recipes in YAML or HCL2

The `package.yml` schema (`schema/package.schema.json`) doubles as editor
autocompletion — add to a recipe:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://go-pkgx.github.io/bk/package.schema.json
```

The same recipe in HCL2 (`package.hcl`) decodes to the identical `Recipe`:

```hcl
distributable {
  url              = "https://curl.se/download/curl-{{version}}.tar.bz2"
  strip-components = 1
}
dependencies = { "openssl.org" = "^1.1", "zlib.net" = "^1.2.11" }
build {
  script = ["./configure $ARGS", "make --jobs {{ hw.concurrency }} install"]
  env    = { ARGS = ["--prefix={{prefix}}", "--with-openssl"] }
}
provides = ["bin/curl", "bin/curl-config"]
```

## Why

Completes the pure-Go [`go-pkgx`](https://github.com/go-pkgx) family (bottle / pkgm /
pkgx / mirror) with the last Deno piece — a single static binary that builds pantry
recipes with no Deno/Ruby/patchelf runtime, and cross-builds cleanly.

## The ELF RUNPATH rewriter

`fixup.SetRunpath` overwrites an ELF's `DT_RUNPATH`/`DT_RPATH` string **in place**
(pure Go): it locates the string offset in `.dynstr` and rewrites the bytes,
zero-padding slack. It cannot grow `.dynstr`, so the build links binaries with a
long `-Wl,-rpath` placeholder that the final `$ORIGIN`-relative value fits inside —
the same budget model `patchelf --set-rpath` sidesteps by rewriting the file.
