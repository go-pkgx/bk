// prefix WITHOUT modifying a byte, and reports what it found.
//
// `FixUp` runs these same checks while it rewrites a freshly built package, so
// nothing it produces can reach the registry unrunnable. A MIRRORED bottle is
// never unpacked — it is republished verbatim — so the guards have no bytes to
// look at and cannot fire. `git-scm.org 2.55.0` reached the catalogue that way:
// 164 of its 164 Mach-O files reach a sibling package only through
// `/Users/runner/.pkgx`, the build machine's own path, so `git` cannot load
// zlib on any other machine. It surfaced weeks later as some other recipe's
// build failure — `git-remote-https died of signal 6`.
//
// This reports and does not refuse. Whether a mirror is REQUIRED to be
// relocatable is a question about what our signature claims, and it is
// go-pkgx/packages#147's to answer; what a publisher should not have to do is
// find out from a third package's dyld error.

// ErrStaleSignature means a Mach-O carries a code signature that no longer

//
// On Apple silicon this is not a load error. The kernel checks each page
// against the code directory at first fault and kills the process outright:
//
//	$ gm version
//	$ echo $?
//	137                              ← SIGKILL, nothing on either stream
//
// There is no dyld message to grep for, which is why an audit that classified
// on the output text recorded 34 dead packages as healthy. The crash report is
// the only thing that says so: termination namespace CODESIGNING, "Invalid
// Page".
//
// `codesign -v` on the EXECUTABLE is no help either — it is usually not the
// file that was edited. `graphicsmagick.org` 1.3.48 is Developer ID signed and
// verifies clean while dying on `gnu.org/libtool`'s `libltdl.7.dylib`.
//
// 2123 files across 56 published project@versions reached the catalogue this
// way before `fixup` learned to re-sign (#96), and every guard here missed
// them: they all read Mach-O *references* and none asked whether the bytes
// still hash to what the signature claims. `MachoSignatureStale` could answer
// it from #101 onwards and nothing ever called it. A guard that is written,
// tested and unwired guards nothing.

// never meant to touch:
//
//	cffa edfe 0c00 0001   before: magic 0xfeedfacf, cputype ARM64
//	cefa edfe 0c00 0001   after:  magic 0xfeedface, cputype ARM64

// darwin — gnu.org/gcc pulls it in at runtime — so a recipe's bare `strip` is
// GNU's, and github.com/rcedgar/muscle 5.3 was built, signed, indexed and
// published as a binary the kernel kills on sight (exit 137, no output).
