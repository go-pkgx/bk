// 164 of its 164 Mach-O files reach a sibling package only through
// `/Users/runner/.pkgx`, the build machine's own path, so `git` cannot load
// zlib on any other machine. It surfaced weeks later as some other recipe's
// build failure — `git-remote-https died of signal 6`.
//
// This reports and does not refuse. Whether a mirror is REQUIRED to be
// relocatable is a question about what our signature claims, and it is
// go-pkgx/packages#147's to answer; what a publisher should not have to do is
// find out from a third package's dyld error.

// two in agreement, and they disagree on both axes:
//
