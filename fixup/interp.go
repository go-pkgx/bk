// fixInterp rewrites a staged interpreter path onto the final prefix.
//
// Almost nothing needs this. A shared library has no PT_INTERP and an ordinary
// executable's names the system loader, which is not under our prefix. The one
// artefact that has both is gnu.org/glibc's libc.so.6, which is executable —
// that is how `libc.so.6 --version` works — and whose PT_INTERP is its OWN
// ld.so, built with --prefix and therefore baked with the staging directory:
//
//	[Requesting program interpreter:
//	   /home/linux1/.pkgx/gnu.org/glibc/v2.44+brewing/lib/glibc-2.44/ld64.so.1]
//
// Two things wrong in one string. `+brewing` is Paths.BuildInstall, which
// exists during the build and nowhere after it. `/home/linux1` is the runner's
// home: a published, signed bottle naming the account that made it.
//
// Measured when it was found (go-pkgx/bk#263): of 250 ELFs sampled in the
// s390x store, exactly one carried a staging interpreter. So this is not a
// sweep that fixes a class — it is one artefact, and the guard is here rather
// than in the glibc recipe because every other consumer of a staged path
// (.pc files, .cmake files, staged scripts, Mach-O install names, and since
// then the ELF RUNPATH) is already unstaged by fixup. PT_INTERP was the one
// program header that was not.
//
// It does NOT make the path portable — the final prefix is still absolute and
// still under whoever's $PKGX_DIR built it. What it buys is that the path
// names a directory that will exist, and that the artefact stops carrying a
// username. Making it relocatable is a different problem, and pkgx solves it
// by never executing libc.so.6 directly.
